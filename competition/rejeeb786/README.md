# OpenShift Web Console Customization Competition

Rejeeb Abdul Rahiman's entry for the OpenShift Web Console Customization Competition.

## Customization details:

You can customize the OpenShift Container Platform web console to set a custom logo, product name, links, notifications, and command-line downloads. These are especially helpful if you need to tailor the web console to meet specific corporate or government requirements.

### Adding a custom logo and product name

* Logos are the face of a business, product, or service. A software customized with the company logo can generate more trust and recognition.

*Procedure to add your company logo within OpenShift:*

1. Import your logo file into a config map in the openshift-config namespace:
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rejeeb786/openshift-web-console-customizations/master/competition/rejeeb786/assets/images/console-custom-logo.png
$ oc create configmap console-custom-logo --from-file console-custom-logo.png -n openshift-config
```
2. Patch the web consoleâ€™s Operator configuration to include customLogoFile and customProductName:
```
$ oc patch console.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' --patch '{"spec":{"customization": { "customLogoFile": {"key":"console-custom-logo.png","name": "console-custom-logo"},"customProductName":"Sample Company Inc"}}}'
```

### Customizing the login page

* Custom login pages can be helpful to show users a branded page that they trust and expect before being redirected to the authentication provider or any other page. You can render custom error pages during the authentication process as well.

*Procedure to add customized page in OpenShift:*

  1. Customized `identity provider selection` page:
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rejeeb786/openshift-web-console-customizations/master/competition/rejeeb786/assets/codes/providers.html
$ oc create secret generic providers-template --from-file=providers.html -n openshift-config
$ oc patch oauths cluster --type='merge' --patch '{"spec":{"templates": { "providerSelection": {"name":"providers-template"}}}}'
```
[<img src="./assets/screenshots/IDPSelectionPageScreenshot.png" width="100%"/>](./assets/screenshots/IDPSelectionPageScreenshot.png)
  2. Customized `login` page:

### Customizing CLI downloads

* You can configure links for downloading the CLI with custom link text and URLs, which can point directly to file packages or to an external page that provides the packages.

*Procedure to include custom download links within OpenShift:*

  * YAML file definition to include `GitHub CLI` download links.
   > gh is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with git and your code.
```
$ cat << 'EOF' > github-cli.yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleCLIDownload
metadata:
  name: github-cli
spec:
  description: |
    gh is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with git and your code. GitHub CLI is available for repositories hosted on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+.
  displayName: GitHub CLI
  links:
  - href: 'https://github.com/cli/cli#homebrew'
    text: GitHub CLI for Linux
  - href: 'https://brew.sh/'
    text: GitHub CLI for Mac

### Adding YAML examples to Kubernetes resources

* You can dynamically add YAML examples to any Kubernetes resources at any time. Providing sample YAML examples helps the user to understand it's working.

*Procedure to add YAML examples within OpenShift:*

  * YAML file definition to add a `Secret` YAML example.
   > The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords, OpenShift Container Platform client configuration files, dockercfg files, private source repository credentials, and so on. Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plug-in or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.
```
$ cat << 'EOF' > secret-yaml-sample.yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleYAMLSample
metadata:
  name: secret-yaml-sample
spec:
  targetResource:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
  title: Example Secret
  description: An example Secret YAML sample
  yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: example
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      email: admin@example.com
      password: RedHat@OCP123!@#
EOF
```
```
$ oc apply -f secret-yaml-sample.yaml
```
[<img src="./assets/screenshots/SecretYAMLScreenshot.png" width="100%"/>](./assets/screenshots/SecretYAMLScreenshot.png)
  * YAML file definition to add a `ConfigMap` YAML example.
   > The `ConfigMap` API object holds key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to store configuration data for system components such as controllers. ConfigMap is similar to secrets, but designed to more conveniently support working with strings that do not contain sensitive information.
```
$ cat << 'EOF' > configmap-yaml-sample.yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleYAMLSample
metadata:
  name: configmap-yaml-sample
spec:
  targetResource:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
  title: Example ConfigMap
  description: An example ConfigMap YAML sample
  yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: special-config 
    data:
      company.name: sample 
      company.product: ocp 
EOF
```
```
$ oc apply -f configmap-yaml-sample.yaml
```
